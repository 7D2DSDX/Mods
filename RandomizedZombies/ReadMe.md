Randomize Zombies' Walk Types, and optionally enable them to run in shades!

A nice blended mod, using Hal9000's Run In the Dark mod, and blended with random walk types and movement speeds, it's sure to provide a more immersive experience for you and your players.

No more manually adding separate entitiy classes just get a different walk speed; this mod updates the master template of the crawler, cop, and zombiemale, and randomizes their walk types when spawned.
