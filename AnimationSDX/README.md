Animation SDX
=============

The AnimatioSDX provides two classes for modders to use: AnimationSDX and MecanimSDX.

AnimationSDX:
	This class uses what's called Legacy Animations, and is added to the entity in Unity as a series of Animations, and to the XML.

MecanimSDX:
	This class ueses what's calld Mecanimation, and allows us to use motion capture animation and an animator state machine to control the entity in game. This allows more complex animation characters with increased flexility over that of Legacy, including configuring a series of animations to be done over several calls.
