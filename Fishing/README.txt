	3.2 - To start fishing you need to bait it with earthworms, 막y pressing R key. Once baited the cane should go down.
	3.3 - When you get a fish poke the cane will start moving and you'll hear a splash sound. React quickly by pressing the left mouse button.
	3.4 - If you catch something, 맟ou then have some seconds to grab the loot by pressing the right mouse button.
